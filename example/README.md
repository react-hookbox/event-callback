This example was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is linked to the patch-styles package in the parent directory for development purposes.

You can run `yarn install` and then `yarn start` to test your package.

Or if you're in the root directory of the package you can run
`yarn example` or `yarn example install` to install packages
and `yarn example start` to start the example application.
You can also run `yarn example add package-name` to install
any package to the example app.
